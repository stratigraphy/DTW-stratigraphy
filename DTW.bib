Primo episodes were characterized by cool high-latitude climates, cold oceanic bottom waters, and high nutrient supply which supported abundant and diverse planktonic communities. Secundo episodes were characterized by warmer high-latitude climates, salinity-dense oceanic bottom waters, low diversity planktonic communities, and carbonate formation in shallow waters.

  abstract = {Computer-assisted stratigraphic correlation can help to produce several scenarios reflecting interpretation uncertainties. In this work, we propose a method which translates sedimentary concepts into a correlation cost for each possible stratigaphic correlation. All these correlation costs are used to populate a cost matrix in order to apply the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and to compute the n-best correlation sets having the n-least cumulative costs. The proposed cost function reflects prior knowledge about sediment transport direction, and it is tested on two wells penetrating a Middle Jurassic reservoir in the North Sea. Well markers are described by two parameters: (1) the sedimentary facies corresponding to a depositional environment, and (2) the relative distality of the well computed from its position along the sediment transport direction. The main principle of correlation used in this article assumes that a well marker (described by a facies and a distality) cannot be correlated with another well marker described by a depositionally deeper facies at a more proximal position, or a depositionally shallower facies at a more distal position. This approach produces consistent stratigraphic well correlations, and highlights the sensitivity of the solution to the facies zonation and to the relative well distality. Therefore, the proposed rule offers a way to coherently consider chronostratigraphic correlation and the associated uncertainties at the parasequence scale, i.e., at a smaller scale than generally considered in deterministic correlation.},

Palaeozoic reef development culminated in the Silurian when several successive reef barriers developed. The present investigation has revealed new reef structures in the upper Silurian sedimentary bedrock. Two new biostromes, E1 and E2, have been found in the Ludlovian Eke Beds, east of Gotland. The biostromes trend in a more or less east-west direction and can be traced across the northern part of the Baltic Sea. In the Pridolian, two reef-like barriers, named B5 and B6, occur at the boundary to the Devonian. The lower barrier, B5, is found to the south of the younger B6 barrier. This indicates that a transgression occurred between the formation of the two barriers. A tentative reconstruction of the Pridolian bay suggests that the coast shifted from a more east-west direction in the Ludlovian to a more north-easterly to south-westerly direction in the Pridolian. Bioherms are commonly associated with...},

  abstract = {The late Ludlow Lau Event was a severe biotic crisis in the Silurian, characterized by resurgent microbial facies and faunal turnover rates otherwise only documented during the "big five" mass extinctions. This asynchronous late Silurian marine extinction event preceded an associated positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE), the Lau CIE, although a mechanism for this temporal offset remains poorly constrained. Here, we report thallium isotope data from locally reducing late Ludlow strata within the Baltic Basin to document the earliest onset of global marine deoxygenation. The initial expansion of anoxia coincided with the onset of the extinction and therefore preceded the Lau CIE. Additionally, sulfur isotope data record a large positive excursion parallel to the Lau CIE, interpreted to indicate an increase in pyrite burial associated with the widely documented CIE. This suggests a possible global expansion of euxinia (anoxic and sulfidic water column) following deoxygenation. These data are the most direct proxy evidence of paleoredox conditions linking the known extinction to the Lau CIE through the progressive expansion of anoxia, and most likely euxinia, across portions of the late Silurian oceans.},

  abstract = {Evidence from sedimentology and conodont biostratigraphy is used to reinterpret the mid-Homerian (Late Wenlock) succession on Gotland, Sweden. A new conodont zonation includes from below: the Ozarkodina bohemica longa Zone (including five subzones), the Kockelella ortus absidata Zone and the Ctenognathodus murchisoni Zone (two taxa are named, Ozarkodina bohemica longa and Pseudooneotodus linguicornis). These new zones are integrated with facies in order to correlate strata and infer the major depositional environments and the controls on deposition during the mid-Homerian Mulde Event. Reef-associated and skeletal carbonate deposition predominated before and after the event, i.e. during the uppermost O. s. sagitta Zone and, again, in the C. murchisoni Zone. These periods are characterized by the expansion of reefs and shoal facies across marls in the topmost Slite Group on eastern Gotland and in the lower parts of the Klinteberg Formation on western Gotland, respectively. The intervening O. b. longa and K. o. absidata zones are initially characterized by rapid facies changes, including siliciclastic deposition, and later stabilisation of a carbonate depositional system. The composition of sediments and depositional rates are closely related to the creation and destruction of accommodation space and reflects a classical case of depositional bias of the carbonate and siliciclastic depositional systems. Based on coastline migration, stratal boundaries, and the stratigraphic position of major reef belts, several facies associations can be fitted into a sequence stratigraphic model for platform evolution. A highstand systems tract (HST) situation prevailed prior to, and during the early part of the event; the upper Slite Group including the lower Fröjel Formation. This HST was characterized by prolific skeletal production and regional reef development except for during the latest stage when carbonate production declined at the onset of the Mulde Event. Platform growth was inhibited during a following regressive systems tract (RST) when regional siliciclastic deposition predominated; the Gannarve Member. The subsequent lowstand resulted in regional emersion and karstification, i.e. a complete termination of the platform. The post-extinction transgressive systems tract (TST) is exclusively composed of non-skeletal carbonates; the Bara Member of the Halla Formation. Re-occurrence of reefs and a prolific skeletal production marks platform recovery during a second HST; the remaining Halla and the lower Klinteberg formations. Integration of high-resolution biostratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy reveals that the major physical control on platform evolution was a 5th order eustatic sea-level change during an early part of the Mulde Event, and that the bulk of the strata accumulated when the platform aggraded and prograded during the highstand systems tracts. Thus, Silurian oceanic events and associated sea-level changes had profound impact on the neritic carbonate system. The Gotland-based middle and late Homerian sea-level curve shows two rapid regressions, both leading to truncation of highstand systems tracts. The first lowstand occurred at the very end of the C. lundgreni Chron, and the second at the end of the Co.? ludensis Chron. The intervening interval was characterized by stillstand or possibly slow transgression.},

However, due to the poor degree of exposure, outcrop studies have not revealed a detailed section from any of these outliers. The first complete stratigraphy of such an erosional remnant, the Burgen outlier, is presented here, based on the recently recovered Burgen-1 drillcore. Stratigraphical units encountered are, from oldest to youngest, the uppermost Hemse Group ({$>$} 35 m), Eke Formation (0.4 m), Burgsvik Formation (3.4 m) and the basal Hamra Formation (12 m preserved). Based on carbon stable isotopes and lithological correlation to nearby outcrops that are zoned by conodonts, it can be concluded that the most profound late Ludlow sedimentary changes took place shortly after the onset of the globally recognized Lau Event (δ13C values reach 8.7 ‰ in the lower Hamra Formation). Sedimentary changes include development of discontinuity surfaces, widespread occurrence of an intraclastic conglomerate, increased microbial activity (Rothpletzella and Wetheredella), and influx of clastics to the basin. These changes are linked to substantial base-level changes during the event. A general comparison with the Prague basin suggests contemporaneous sedimentary changes on Baltica and on cratonic elements from peri-Gondwana during the event. © 2006 Cambridge Univesity Press.},

Based on the classical Silurian carbonate platform strata of Gotland, Sweden, a "minor" biotic event is herein for the first time related to a substantial increase in anachronistic facies. Strata deposited during and shortly after the Lau Event in the Baltic paleobasin (Eke and Burgsvik Formations) include evidence for reduced grazing and infaunal activity in contemporaneous shallow low-latitude seas, e.g., flat-pebble conglomerates, normal-marine stromatolites, mass occurrence of oncoids, and subtidal wrinkle structures (e.g., Kinneyia and microripples). The latter structures have recently been suggested to be restricted to Proterozoic-Cambrian and Early Triassic time and therefore are regarded as anomalous for the Phanerozoic. The co-occurrence of these facies and global extinctions among pentamerid brachiopods and conodonts suggests that minor extinction events also resulted in anachronistic periods, less devastating but fully comparable to those in the aftermath of the end-Ordovician and end-Permian mass extinctions. A global positive stable carbon isotope excursion and the last appearance datum of the conodont Polygnathoides siluricus may facilitate identification of the Late Silurian anachronistic period elsewhere.},

  abstract = {A shoreline to deep basin correlation chart for the middle Silurian coupled extinction-stable isotopic event is presented. The chart is a first attempt to synthesise new stratigraphic, faunal and stable isotopic data, as well as diversity changes among organic-walled microplankton (acritarchs), from the Grötlingbo-1 and Hunninge-1 cores on Gotland (Sweden), along with previously published data from the Bartoszyce IG 1 core (Poland), the Gräfenwarth section (Germany), and the Ruhnu (500) and Ohesaare cores (Estonia). Accordingly, the relative timing of biotic, sedimentary, and stable isotopic changes associated with the event can be studied in high stratigraphic resolution across a basin area of \textbackslash sim120 000 km2 (in the epicontinental Baltic Basin) and further off the Silurian continental margin into the Rheic Ocean (Gräfenwarth section). A graptolite biozonation is presented for the Late Wenlock of the Grötlingbo-1 core and the middle Silurian carbon isotope excursion (CIE) is for the first time detected in stratigraphically continuous sections on Gotland. It starts close above the LAD of Monograptus flemingii and peaks at d13C values of 2.4\% in the Grötlingbo-1 core and at 3.8\% in the Hunninge-1 core. The correlation chart forms the basis for several important conclusions for the mid-Silurian event: (a) it is associated with major and synchronous sedimentary changes across the basin independent of palaeodepth, i.e., the entire marine realm, from shoreline to deep basin, was affected; (b) the onset of the CIE is within the latest part of a regressive systems tract and related to carbonate platform exposure and termination; (c) the CIE peak interval correlates with the early transgressive systems tract and the development of laminated strata in the deeper parts of epicontinental seas, as well as with increased accumulation of organic matter in even deeper basins; (d) the major diversity anomalies among planktonic and nektonic taxa precede or occur close to the onset of the CIE. © 2006 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association).},

  abstract = {Recent and ancient carbonate platforms are major marine ecosystems, built by various carbonate-secreting organisms with different sensitivity for environmental change. For this reason, carbonate platforms are excellent sensors for changes in contemporaneous marine environments. A variety of ecosystem changes in carbonate platforms have previously been recognised in the aftermath of mass extinction events. This paper addresses how two Silurian extinction events among graptolites, conodonts, and pentamerid brachiopods can be related to changes in the style of carbonate production and general evolution of low latitude carbonate platforms in a similar way as previously reported from the major five mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. Strata formed on Gotland during the Mulde and Lau events share remarkably many similarities but are strikingly different in composition compared to other strata on the island. The event-related strata is characterised by the sudden appearance of widespread oolites, deviating reef composition, flat-pebble conglomerates, abundant micro- and macro-oncoids, stromatolites, and other microbial facies suggesting decreased bioturbation levels in contemporaneous shelf seas. Importantly, these changes can be tied to high-resolution biostratigraphic frameworks and global stable isotope excursions. The anomalous intervals may therefore be searched for elsewhere in order to test their regional or global significance. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

  abstract = {Mass extinction events affect a wide breadth of ecosystems and are one of the major driving mechanisms behind evolution, origination, and diversification of taxa. Such dramatic turnovers have therefore played a significant role in the history of life. The 'major five' mass extinctions (Raup and Sepkoski 1982) have received intense attention over the last 25 years, starting with the K-Pg impact hypothesis launched by Luis Alvarez and others in Science in 1980. By comparison, few studies have concerned the about sixty smaller-scale bioevents that are scattered throughout the last ca 543 million years (Barnes et al. 1995), although their architecture often resembles that of the large scale mass-extinctions and they therefore may hold important information relevant to events in general. The Silurian Period is the shortest time period of the entire Phanerozoic (\textbackslash sim443-416 Ma) but yields a significant record of ocean-atmospherebiosphere changes. The period has traditionally been described as an environmentally and faunally stable period in Earth history - a greenhouse period with a moderate latitudinal climate gradient and impoverished marine faunas slowly recovering from the end-Ordovician mass extinction. It has more recently, however, been shown that the Silurian was no quieter than any other time interval during the Phanerozoic Eon, rather the opposite. The results of an immense number of studies, primarily in the fields of taxonomy, biostratigraphy and stable isotope stratigraphy clash fundamentally with the old view. The new studies have unequivocally shown that repeated marine biodiversity crises took place, affecting e.g. graptolites, conodonts, chitinozoans, acritarchs, brachiopods and reefs, and that these turnovers were closely linked to abrupt and significant changes in oceanography and the global carbon cycle. Accordingly, today the Silurian can be regarded as one of the most volatile periods of the entire Phanerozoic when considering the ocean-atmosphere system (Cramer and Saltzman 2005). In order to understand these changes we need to see beyond the defined stratigraphic boundaries of the Silurian System and treat the time interval in a broader context. This is because the Silurian global events form part of a series of ocean-atmosphere-biosphere changes ranging in time from the Late Ordovician and through the Early Devonian (Fig. 1). In the authors opinion the Silurian global events require fundamental changes in Earth's climate, which are best explained by a series of glaciations. The lack of sedimentary evidence such as tillites from middle and younger Silurian formations has so far hindered the acceptance of this hypothesis. This is the first thematic publication in more than ten years in which the Silurian global events are treated in close context with the major five extinction events of the Phanerozoic. The previous publication was the result of the IGCP Project 216 'Global Biological Events in Earth History' in which the Silurian bioevents were treated by Kaljo et al. (1995). This chapter calls attention to the tremendous development of Silurian stratigraphy achieved in this last decade and how it generates a fundamentally new view of the Silurian Period as a time interval of repeated global change. The three main events - the Early Silurian Ireviken Event, the Middle Silurian Mulde Event, and the Late Silurian Lau Event - are reviewed with regard to biodiversity changes and how these relate to carbon and oxygen stable isotope evolution and sea-level change. Much of these data presented herein come from the island of Gotland (Sweden; Fig. 2) were a series of stacked carbonate platform generations, ranging in age from the latest Llandovery through the Ludlow, are preserved. Accordingly, this contribution should be seen as 'a view from a carbonate platform' situated on the paleocontinent Baltica in the Silurian tropics, although other areas are referred to as far as possible. In order to stimulate research, facilitate the identification of the Silurian global events elsewhere, and establish a coherent working frame, this paper also serves to present and define the stratigraphical extent of these three events, in terms of first and last appearance datums (FAD's and LAD's), and their expression in shallow-water environments. As the reader will learn, the comparably small-scale Silurian global events share unexpectedly many similarities with the great mass extinctions (Munnecke et al. 2003; Calner 2005a). © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Climatically the Silurian was a most unstable period, as it is shows several strong d 13 C excursion, with the Lau excursion being the strongest short-lived positive d 13 C excursion of the entire Phanerozoic. The causes of these excursions are still debated. In order to determine how benthic communities responded to these climatic perturbations, a microfacies analysis of carbonate rocks from the Silurian (Late Telychian to the uppermost Ludfordian) of the Gotland was carried out. Reef development was strongly enhanced during periods with carbon isotope excursions, compared to time intervals without. In times of very high d 13 C values (≥ 3‰) bryozoans and microbes become more abundant and, in some areas, form reefs (Bryostromatolites), while corals and stromatoporoids were the main reef builders in periods of lower isotope ratios (0-3‰). In addition, a signicant increase of phosphatic components, gypsum pseudomorphs and the microproblematicum Palaeomicrocodium is observed in times of increased isotope ratios. A model is proposed explaining the changes in the benthic communities over time. It is based on previously published models which assume climatic shifts from humid to arid climate but adds phosphorous in sea water as an important factor for the development of the benthic communities.},

  abstract = {The Wenlock Epoch of the Silurian Period has become one of the chronostratigraphically best-constrained intervals of the Paleozoic. The integration of multiple chronostratigraphic tools, such as conodont and graptolite biostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy, and δ 13 C carb chemostratigraphy, has greatly improved global chronostratigraphic correlation and portions of the Wenlock can now be correlated with precision better than ±100kyr. Additionally, such detailed and integrated chronostratigraphy provides an opportunity to evaluate the fidelity of individual chronostratigraphic tools. Here, we use conodont biostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy and carbon isotope (δ 13 C carb ) chemostratigraphy to demonstrate that the conodont Kockelella walliseri, an important guide fossil for middle and upper Sheinwoodian strata (lower stage of the Wenlock Series), first appears at least one full stratigraphic sequence lower in Laurentia than in Baltica. Rather than serving as a demonstration of the unreliability of conodont biostratigraphy, this example serves to demonstrate the promise of high-resolution Paleozoic stratigraphy. The temporal difference between the two first occurrences was likely less than 1million years, and although it is conceptually understood that speciation and colonization must have been non-instantaneous events, Paleozoic paleobiogeographic variability on such short timescales (tens to hundreds of kyr) traditionally has been ignored or considered to be of little practical importance. The expansion of high-resolution Paleozoic stratigraphy in the future will require robust biostratigraphic zonations that embrace the integration of multiple chronostratigraphic tools as well as the paleobiogeographic variability in ranges that they will inevitably demonstrate. In addition, a better understanding of the paleobiogeographic migration histories of marine organisms will provide a unique tool for future Paleozoic paleoceanography and paleobiology research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

A series of eight samples, spaced by 5 cm, were taken from the Hunninge-1 drillcore in Gotland, Sweden, and were analysed in order to establish the vertical element composition and variation in the bentonite. The results show that the Götlingbo Bentonite originates from one source magma and from one single eruption. The lowermost 0.1-0.15 m of the bentonite (compacted) was deposited from air-transport fall-out, whereas the upper portions have been reworked in a shallow-marine environment and re-deposited. Vertical differences in Ti and Zr within the Grötlingbo Bentonite mean that regional correlation of the bed may need several samples at each locality to be reliable. © 2012 Copyright Geologiska Föreningen.},

To perform cross-validation of the method, we introduce a distance comparing the relative geological time of two models for each geographic position, and we compare the models in terms of volumes.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates a time interval within the Late Ludfordian (Late Silurian), involving changes in faunal composition (the Lau Event), a major positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE), and contemporaneous sea-level changes in remote palaeo-basins. Based on the Silurian strata of Gotland (Sweden), we integrate sequence stratigraphy, carbon isotope stratigraphy, and platform-scale palaeoecological changes associated with this turbulent time period in Earth history. Three depositional sequences (sequences Nos. 1–3), including two separate periods of forced regression (falling stage systems tracts, FSSTs) are identified from outcrop and drillcore studies. The sequence stratigraphical framework is interpreted to reflect glacio-eustatic sea-level changes. The CIE starts at the onset of the initial FSST (sequence No. 1), just below the last appearance datum of the conodont Polygnathoides siluricus. The values increase through the ensuing lowstand and transgressive systems tracts (LST and TST) of sequence No. 2 and peak in the following highstand systems tract (HST). A second forced regression (FSST of sequence No. 2) took place in the lower Ozarkodina snajdri Zone. δ13C data are scarce from these siliciclastic strata, but inferably remain high. The δ13C values increase within the LST and earliest TST of sequence No. 3, before a decreasing trend starts within the early TST. δ13C values return to pre-excursion levels within the ensuing HST. The CIE is closely associated with an increase in stromatolites (mats and oncoids) across a wide range of depths and sedimentary environments, and correlations to other basins indicate a global increase in cyanobacterial activity. A drastic decline in level-bottom benthic faunas during the FSST of sequence No. 2 is, however, interpreted as a local response to the progradation of a delta complex (the Burgsvik Sandstone). Biological carbonate production replenishes rapidly within the TST of sequence No. 3, succeeding a thin LST dominated by reworked siliciclastics and chemically precipitated carbonates (ooids). The detailed relationship between the CIE and sea-level change presented herein is not fully consistent with previous reports on the CIEs associated with the lower Silurian Ireviken and Mulde events, respectively. Based on our facies analysis and sequence stratigraphical interpretation, two main mechanisms are suggested as responsible for the Late Ludfordian CIE: (1) a change in the riverine C-weathering flux towards the 13C end member following glacio-eustatically induced subaerial exposure of carbonate platforms throughout the tropics, and, (2) increased photosynthetic activity by benthic cyanobacteria exaggerating the δ13C values of precipitated carbonates.},

The newly established log stratigraphy is also linked to the existing seismic stratigraphic framework for the study area and exemplified with a selection of interpreted seismic type sections from Gotland and the south Baltic Sea.

In this paper they are named the Klinte Reef (Klinteberg Formation unit f), the Hammarudden Reef (Hemse Group ‘younger' units a-c), the Östergarn Reef (Hemse Group unit d) and the Millklint Reef (Hemse Group unit e). The reef units form a mainly regressive succession with younger reefs resting on the seaward slopes of older reefs. The reef succession is exposed on Gotland and in the Baltic Sea east of Gotland, whereas towards the East Baltic coast it is overlain by Pridoli sedimentary bedrock. Each reef unit corresponds to a welldefined seismic unit with distinct facies zonality ranging from lagoon via reef barrier and biohermal slope to basin facies. The ‘fore-reef' facies is in this paper termed biohermal slope to express its characteristic reefal features. Reconstruction of the post-depositional tilting of the sequence indicates lagoonal depths of up to 10 m. The reef barriers developed at depths of up to 20 m and the biohermal slopes at between 10 and 55 m. The reef barrier and the biohermal slope are generally separated by a debris fan of waste products from the reef, 1-2 km wide. The reef barriers are generally 1-3 km wide, which is about the same width as their lagoons. The biohermal slopes become successively wider towards the upper part of reef succession, ranging from 5-9 km at the Klinte Reef to 15-18 km at the Millklint Reef. Comparisons with the Gotland sequence show that the reef barriers are biostromal stromatoporoid reefs in a matrix of crinoid debris. The biostromes are of the Kuppen type. The bioherms are of the Axelro and Hoburgen types. The bioherms occur randomly on the seaward slope of the barriers. © 2001 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association).},

  abstract = {The present study reviews the main geochemical, sedimentological, and paleontological events associated with one of the largest perturbations in the Phanerozoic carbon cycle, the Mid-Ludfordian Carbon Isotope Excursion (MLCIE), which is globally documented in late Silurian marine successions. Climate changes associated with the MLCIE are not yet well documented in contrast to most other Silurian CIEs. We report seawater surface temperature changes across the entire MLCIE using δ18Oapatite records of conodonts originating from different regions located in temperate as well as tropical paleolatitudes. Significant positive δ18Oapatite excursions (up to 3.8‰) measured in temperate-water areas of the Prague Basin and Carnic Alps (peri-Gondwana) as well as in the tropical areas of Baltica (Laurussia) and Australia (Gondwana) provide evidence for significant global cooling during the MLCIE. The marked cooling of sea surface temperatures, coupled with a significant eustatic sea-level fall recorded on all corresponding paleocontinents, point to a major glaciation in polar and subpolar Gondwana which is denominated here as the “Mid-Ludfordian Glaciation”. The onset of rapid cooling in the Prague Basin (peri-Gondwana) is preceded by the deposition of shales enriched in redox-sensitive trace metals suggesting that anoxic/euxinic waters expanded on the deeper carbonate shelf just before the MLCIE. The coincidence of culmination of the anoxic event (named here as the Siluricus Ocean Anoxic Event) with the Lau/Kozlowskii extinction events is documented for the first time outside of the Laurussian epeiric basins. Widespread oxygen-deficient conditions are interpreted to have been stressful to shelfal ecosystems and may have been a major cause of the extinctions. The mid-Ludfordian glacio-eustatic sea-level fall caused a reduction of shelf habitats culminating in a lower faunal diversity and a change in the structure of faunal communities. The observed positive δ18Oapatite excursion is tightly coupled to δ13C and δ34S anomalies documented from temperate (peri-Gondwana) as well as tropical (Laurussia) paleolatitudes. The δ18Oapatite data complete the Silurian seawater temperature curve and show evidence that one of the largest positive carbon isotope anomalies (MLCIE) of the Phanerozoic was preceded by a widespread anoxic event and tightly linked with a climate cooling event as documented as well for most other Silurian CIEs.},

  abstract = {Paired records of δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg across the Llandovery-Wenlock boundary demonstrate asynchronous behavior during the onset of the Ireviken Biogeochemical Event (IBE). The extremely high-resolution data produced from the Altajme Core, drilled from Gotland, Sweden, capture a negative excursion in δ13Corg during the initiation of the Ireviken Extinction Event (IEE) and prior to the onset of the Ireviken positive δ13Ccarb Excursion (ICIE). The record of carbon isotopic changes through this interval illustrate that both Δ13C (the difference between δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg) as well as the relative flux of organic carbon burial (forg) vary in unique ways and at different times during the progression of the IBE. Both process-oriented variables within the global carbon cycle (Δ13C and forg) track a series of events that help to demonstrate potential causative mechanisms of both the extinction and carbon cycle perturbation. The sequence of events demonstrated here largely mirror the cascade of events that took place during the Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2) and a detailed comparison between the two events is provided here for the first time. The unique insight into the IBE presented in this work results primarily from the novel, nearly Neogene-scale resolution of the paired isotope data, which demonstrates the critical importance of high-resolution chemostratigraphic research to evaluating ancient perturbations to the Earth-life system. Additional data sets of equal or greater resolution through this interval will be critical to evaluate the global synchroneity of these short-lived events during the IBE, and similar high-resolution studies of other Paleozoic biogeochemical events may shed light on potentially similar causative mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The visual alignment of chemostratigraphic excursions enables correlation of sedimentary successions within the bounds of geochronology or biostratigraphy. This correlation facilitates the extrapolation of ages from radiometrically calibrated stratigraphic sections to others lacking temporal constraints. For Ediacaran and Cambrian applications, this practice commonly involves assigning ages to fossil first appearances, thereby resolving the tempo of early animal evolution. Chronologies, and the resulting evolutionary insights that they permit, frequently rely on the identification of a single, unique alignment between a time-calibrated and a time-uncertain section, yet visual correlation methods do not permit evaluating the uniqueness of such a chronology. Here we use a dynamic programming algorithm to determine a range of alignments between stratigraphic sections that are optimal under certain assumptions about total temporal overlap and sedimentation rates. We apply the algorithm to radiometrically calibrated Cambrian δ13Ccarb records to catalog a library of statistically significant and reproducible alignments. While a subset of the dynamic programming alignments support the statistical significance of published visual alignments, the remaining yield additional, significant correlation solutions that do not violate lithostratigraphic constraints. We conclude that the range of temporal inferences for fossil first appearances that arise from multiple chemostratigraphic alignments should be accounted for in assessing the timing of early Cambrian animal diversification.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of alignment of magnetic susceptibility (MS) stratigraphic sections by means of the dynamic time warping (DTW) approach was tested with positive results. The DTW is a robust and effective tool for the alignment of the sequential MS data which is particularly sensitive to MS-log patterns, their details, successions, distortion or absence from logs. Moreover, the DTW performance proved to be appropriate for sections which involve a great deal of irregularly spread compacted or thick-bedded intervals and variously positioned and sized gaps. In view of the fact that the lateral changes in short- to medium-term sedimentation rates and local variations in diagenetic compaction are not exceptional but rather common features of the compared sedimentary sections, the DTW becomes a significant tool for stratigraphic comparison of sections with good potential of becoming an alternative to cyclostratigraphic correlation methods. Conditions governing the formation of Lower Devonian (Pragian) carbonate clinoforms obviously appear to be this case, and testing of the DTW on this type of MS sections suggests that the computationally robust results remain approximately the same, even if the importance of high values (peaks) is nonlinearly decreased or increased. In such cases the DTW outperforms the distortion-based vector quantisation (VQ), continuous density hidden Markov models (CDHMM), wavelet transformation (WT) or cross-correlation (CC) based approaches. The near absence of artificially introduced preconditions or predefined elements is also an advantage. The alignment of the sections using the DTW gives us warning about distorted intervals, thus reducing the risk of assembling quite different types of rhythmic patterns or cycles together. The overall ambition of this paper is to introduce the DTW alignment technique as an effective tool for MS log correlation. Extensive testing of the requirements for input data and constraints according to maximum differences between the compared stratigraphic segments are reserved for other studies. For the Pragian of the Barrandian area (specifically, calciturbidite-dominated clinoforms), the DTW-based interconnection between the relevant points of two sections has a resolution which is close to sampling distances (several cm) and is about two orders of magnitude higher compared to that which can be achieved by the bio-, chemo- or lithostratigraphic tools. The first results confirmed the presence of numerous visible and hidden gaps and condensations in the sections.},

That interval includes sedimentary facies otherwise unknown in older Wenlock to early Ludlow strata on Gotland. The identified sequence of changes includes a detailed record of, in order: two extinctions (Datum points 1 and 1.5); widespread deposition of carbon-rich sediments extensive enough to cause a δ13C increase of c. 4.8‰, the onset, maximum and end of a sea-level fall and rise of at least 16m during 30 kyr; a third extinction (Datum 2); a disaster fauna; and a slow faunal recovery. Thus, a secondary result of the event was a weakened greenhouse effect triggering a glaciation: the Gannarve Glaciation (new term). The order of changes proves that regression did not cause the extinctions. Faunal and sea-level changes, as well as the sedimentary succession, fit well with predictions based on an oceanic model. Extinctions were primarily caused by a severe drop in primary planktonic productivity, causing starvation among planktonic larvae in non-coastal settings. The Grötlingbo Bentonite (new term), the thickest in the Wenlock of Gotland, was deposited across the basin shortly after Datum 2.

This method was applied to the Malampaya buildup (a well documented offshore gas field located NW of the Palawan Island, Philippines), aged upper Eocene to lower Miocene. Previous studies highlight that rock petrophysical properties are mainly controlled by diagenesis. Correlation rules are thus developed in order to adapt the stochastic stratigraphic well correlation method to the study of diagenetic units. These rules are based on wireline log shape and diagenetic units types. Four stratigraphic correlation models are generated using the proposed correlation method: a deterministic one corresponding to the most probable model considering only well data and three stochastic ones. These correlation models are bound with geostatistical methods to build static reservoir models. Synthetic seismic profiles are computed from facies models conditioned to acoustic impedance models. It leads to comparable seismic amplitude images, highlighting the importance of considering several well correlation models for one given seismic survey. Stochastic stratigraphic correlations are shown to have a first-order impact on reservoir unit characterization, rock volumes and fluid flow response on the reservoir model. © The Geological Society of London 2012.},

When available, low-frequency stratigraphic events are correlated first, and then used to constrain the correlation of higher-order events. All DTW variants use elementary correlation costs corresponding to the likelihood of each possible horizon. The method is demonstrated on a carbonate ramp of the Cretaceous southern Provence Basin, SE France, using costs that measure the consistency between the computed platform slope angle and a theoretical depositional profile.

During the Silurian its subsidence was governed by the flexural bending of the EEC margin due to the collision of Eastern Avalonia and Baltica. Two mechanisms - orogenesis and dynamic loading - were responsible for the flexural subsidence of the basin. Lithofacies, sequence- and cyclo-stratigraphic analysis were applied to reveal the tectonosedimentary evolution of the Silurian Baltic Basin, focusing on the imprint of geodynamic processes in adjacent orogens on the sedimentary architecture. Adopting a sequence stratigraphic approach, 10 depositional sequences superimposed by the lower rank cycles were identified in the Silurian Baltic Basin. The Llandovery sequences correspond with the initial stage of flexuring. The low terrigenous influx to the basin is explained by the lack of relief in the fold belt and its location at a distance from the orogenic front. The Wenlock-Lower Ludlow sequences reflect the accelerating flexuring. An increase in orogenic-sourced terrigenous material indicates the advancement of the Caledonian orogen. The Late Ludlow-Pridoli sequences comprise the final stages of flexuring and basin infilling. Two major provenances - cratonic and orogenic - competed to supply terrigenous sediment to the basin during Silurian times.},

  abstract = {The Swedish island of Gotland is located within the Baltic Basin. During the Late Ordovician the region around Gotland was part of a shallow epicratonic basin in the southern subtropics. In these warm-water environments algae flourished, diverse reefs developed close to the coastline and further outboard carbonate mounds developed. These mounds formed rigid high relief structures surrounded by fine-grained siliciclastics and marls and can be detected on seismic images as isolated concave upwards features. The sedimentary succession beneath Gotland was intensely investigated in the 1970s and 1980s for its hydrocarbon potential, and subsequently, oil was commercially produced from reservoirs within Ordovician mounds. In 1981, a 3D seismic survey was conducted by Horizon Exploration Ltd. over the Fardume mound on northern Gotland. To date no results from these 3D data have been published in scientific literature. The region of Gotland aims to produce 100\% of its energy from renewable sources and currently the majority of Gotland's energy is provided by wind turbines. Due to the intermittent nature of wind power, one solution to regulate the supply of electricity from wind energy is Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). In this study, we convert the 3D seismic survey acquired over the Fardume mound from scanned TIFF images to SEGY format. These data are then utilized together with well data to gain a better knowledge of the geological structure of the mound and to examine its reservoir characteristics and potential for CAES. To date, carbonate mounds on Gotland have mainly been reported in the scientific literature using well data. This 3D seismic survey, therefore, provides a rare opportunity to better characterize and investigate the structure of one of the carbonate mounds on Gotland.},

The instanta-neous isochron attribute measures thickness between reflec-tions and is therefore generally proportional to sediment accumulation rate.

  abstract = {The biostratigraphical data obtained from the Grötlingbo-1 core section (southern Gotland, Sweden) enable recognition of most of the regional stages known from the Sandbian (Upper Ordovician) to lower Sheinwoodian (Wenlock, Silurian) interval in the East Baltic. The strata corresponding to the Upper Ordovician Keila–Nabala stages have markedly reduced thicknesses in the Grötlingbo-1 core section. Gaps of considerable duration were recognised in some parts of the section: lithological evidence suggest that only lower part of the Pirgu Stage (corresponds to all or part of the Jonstorp Formation) is represented in the section; in the Llandovery, strata corresponding to the Aspelundia? fluegeli and Distomodus staurognathoides Conodont Zones (CZs), and to the Pterospathodus eopennatus CZ (equivalent to the Conochitina alargada and Eisenackitina dolioliformisChitinozoan Zones (CtZs)) are missing. Graptolites from the core indicate that the sedimentary record above the Aeronian to middle Telychian gap recommences in the lower part of the Oktavites spiralis Graptolite Zone (GZ). Co-occurrences of conodonts, graptolites and chitinozoans agree with earlier data suggesting correlation between the lower boundaries of the Cyrtograptus lapworthiGZ and Pterospathodus amorphognathoides amorphognathoides CZ, and between the lower and middle parts of the Ireviken Event and the upper Cyrtograptus murchisoni GZ.},

  abstract = {The first appearance of pinnacle reef tracts, composed of hundreds to thousands of localized biogenic structures protruding tens to hundreds of meters above the surrounding mid-Silurian seafloor, represents a step change in the evolution of the marine biosphere. This change in seafloor morphology opened a host of new ecological niches that served as “evolutionary cradles” for organism diversification. However, the exact timing and drivers of this event remain poorly understood. These uncertainties remain, in large part, due to a paucity of index fossils in the reef facies, the difficulty of correlating between the offshore pinnacle reefs and more temporally well-constrained shallow marine facies, and cryptic unconformities that separate amalgamated reefs. Here we use δ 13 C carb stratigraphy within a sequence stratigraphic framework to unravel these complex relationships and constrain the origination of Silurian pinnacle reef tracts in the North American midcontinent to near the Pt. celloni Superzone—Pt. am. amorphognathoides Zonal Group boundary of the mid-Telychian Stage. In addition, we identify a striking relationship between pulses of reef development and changes in global δ 13 C carb values and sea level. Viewed through this new perspective, we correlate prolific periods of reef development with short-lived carbon isotope (δ 13 C carb ) excursions and eustatic sea level change that, ultimately, reflect perturbations to the global carbon cycle. From changes in the dominance of microbial reefs of the Cambrian to metazoan colonization of reefs in the Middle Ordovician, through the subsequent collapse of metazoan diversity with the Late Ordovician mass extinction, and the first appearance of early Silurian (Llandovery) pinnacle reef tracts and their proliferation during the late Silurian (Wenlock-Pridoli) and Devonian, major reef formation intervals increasingly coincide with δ 13 C carb excursions. These patterns suggest that Paleozoic reef evolution was the product of environmental forcing by perturbations of the global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {When Milankovitch cycles are preserved in the geologic record they provide a direct link between chronometer and climate change, and thus a remarkable opportunity to constrain the evolution of the surficial Earth System. The identification of such cycles has allowed exploration of the geologic record with unprecedented temporal resolution, and has spurred the development of a rich theoretical framework for climatic change. Accompanying these successes, however, has been a persistent skepticism: how does one reliably test for astronomical forcing/pacing in stratigraphic and paleoclimate data, especially when time is poorly constrained? From this perspective, it would seem that the merits and promise of astrochronology – a Phanerozoic time scale measured in 20,000 to 400,000 year increments – also serves as its Achilles heel, if the confirmation of such geologically short temporal rhythms defies rigorous hypothesis testing. The implications are substantial, since much of our understanding of paleoclimate change throughout the Cenozoic (and beyond) is firmly rooted in astrochronologic interpretation. In this study, a conceptual framework for assessing Earth System response to astronomical-insolation changes, and the propagation of that signal into the geologic record, is used as a guide to understand the nature of the problem of astrochronologic testing. This framework emphasizes three challenges – contamination, stratigraphic distortion, and temporal calibration. A statistical optimization method (TimeOpt; Meyers, 2015) is formulated as a solution to these three challenges, providing an approach for astrochronologic testing that objectively evaluates time scale uncertainty while simultaneously identifying an optimal model for climate and depositional system response to astronomical forcing. New extensions to the technique are presented, allowing explicit reconstruction of distortions to the primary forcing that are known to be omnipresent in the stratigraphic record. To illustrate the utility of this approach, it is applied to five well-studied stratigraphic series throughout the Phanerozoic, supporting their astronomical origin, and yielding constraints on the evolution of the Earth System and the astronomical solutions themselves. Future directions that build on this foundation are discussed, including the utility of process-based null models, approaches for Earth System transfer function reconstruction, and mapping out ancient Solar System behavior and Earth-Moon history using the geologic archive of Milankovitch cycles. The TimeOpt approach recognizes astronomy, geochronology, paleoclimatology and depositional system reconstruction as a unified geoscientific inverse problem.},

  abstract = {Marine turbidite paleoseismology relies on the assumption of synchronous triggering of turbidity currents by earthquake shaking to infer rupture extent and recurrence. Such inference commonly depends on age dating and correlation of the physical stratigraphy of deposits carried by turbidity currents (i.e., turbidites) across great distances. Along the Cascadia subduction zone, which lies offshore the Pacific Northwest, USA, turbidite facies in core photographs, X-ray computed tomography images, and magnetic susceptibility (MS) data exhibit differences in character over relatively short distances, which implies that not all deposits can be correlated with confidence. Thus, subjective correlation based on expected similarity over great distances and weak age constraints does not independently support paleoseismic models. We present a new method for correlating turbidites along the Cascadia margin that can yield a more objective and repeatable stratigraphic framework to underpin earthquake recurrence. We use dynamic time warping to correlate MS logs and measure correlation coefficients of core pairs to evaluate correlation strength. We then compare these measures to a distribution of correlation coefficients of randomly generated turbidite sequences and find that only a small number of core pairs can be correlated more confidently than randomly stacked turbidites. This methodology promises a more robust correlation strategy for future stratigraphic studies.},

  abstract = {Mining sequential data is an old topic that has been revived in the last decade, due to the increasing availability of sequential datasets. Most works in this field are centred on the definition and use of a distance (or, at least, a similarity measure) between sequences of elements. A measure called dynamic time warping (DTW) seems to be currently the most relevant for a large panel of applications. This article is about the use of DTW in data mining algorithms, and focuses on the computation of an average of a set of sequences. Averaging is an essential tool for the analysis of data. For example, the K-means clustering algorithm repeatedly computes such an average, and needs to provide a description of the clusters it forms. Averaging is here a crucial step, which must be sound in order to make algorithms work accurately. When dealing with sequences, especially when sequences are compared with DTW, averaging is not a trivial task. Starting with existing techniques developed around DTW, the article suggests an analysis framework to classify averaging techniques. It then proceeds to study the two major questions lifted by the framework. First, we develop a global technique for averaging a set of sequences. This technique is original in that it avoids using iterative pairwise averaging. It is thus insensitive to ordering effects. Second, we describe a new strategy to reduce the length of the resulting average sequence. This has a favourable impact on performance, but also on the relevance of the results. Both aspects are evaluated on standard datasets, and the evaluation shows that they compare favourably with existing methods. The article ends by describing the use of averaging in clustering. The last section also introduces a new application domain, namely the analysis of satellite image time series, where data mining techniques provide an original approach. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Early Silurian (∼431 Ma) carbonate rocks record a ca. 4.5‰ positive excursion in the stable isotopic composition of carbonate carbon (δ13Ccarb). Associated with this isotopic shift is a macroevolutionary turnover pulse known as the ‘Ireviken Event'. The onset of this carbon isotope excursion is commonly associated with a shallowing-upward facies transition that may have been accompanied by climatic change, as indicated by a parallel positive shift (∼0.6‰) in the stable isotopic composition of carbonate oxygen (δ18Ocarb). However, the relationships among carbon cycle perturbations, faunal turnover, and environmental changes remain enigmatic. Here we present a suite of new isotopic data across the Ireviken Event from multiple sections in Gotland, Sweden. These samples preserve no systematic change in δ18Ocarb but show positive excursions of equal magnitude in both carbonate (δ13Ccarb) and organic (δ13Corg) carbon. In addition, the data reveal a synchronous perturbation in sulfur isotope ratios, manifest as a ca. 7‰ positive excursion in carbonate-associated sulfate (δ34SCAS) and a ca. 30‰ positive excursion in pyrite (δ34Spyr). The increase in δ34Spyr values is accompanied by a substantial, concomitant increase in stratigraphic variability of δ34Spyr. The relatively constant offset between the δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg excursions throughout the Ireviken Event could be attributed to increased organic carbon burial, or possibly a change in the isotopic composition of CO2 sources from weathering. However, a positive correlation between carbonate abundance and δ13Ccarb suggests that local to regional changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) during the shallowing-upward sequence may have been at least partly responsible for the observed excursion. The positive excursion recorded in δ34SCAS suggests a perturbation of sufficient magnitude and duration to have impacted the marine sulfate reservoir. An inverse correlation between CAS abundance and δ34SCAS supports the notion of decreased sulfate concentrations, at least locally, consistent with a concomitant increase in pyrite burial. A decrease in the offset between δ34SCAS and δ34Spyr values during the Ireviken Event suggests a substantial reduction in the isotopic fractionations (ϵpyr) expressed during microbial sulfur cycling and pyrite precipitation through this interval. Decreased ϵpyr and the concomitant increase in stratigraphic variation in δ34Spyr are typical of isotope systematics observed in modern shallow-water environments, associated with increased closed-system behavior and/or oxidative sedimentary reworking during early sediment diagenesis. While the isotopic trends associated with the Ireviken Event have been observed in multiple locations around the globe, many sections display different magnitudes of isotopic change, and moreover, are typically associated with local facies changes. Due to the stratigraphic coherence of the carbon and sulfur isotopic and abundance records across the Ireviken Event, and their relationship to changes in local depositional environment, we surmise that these patterns more closely reflect biogeochemical processes related to deposition and lithification of sediment than global changes in carbon and sulfur burial fluxes.},

  abstract = {The Silurian of Gotland is characterized by repeated changes in depositional facies development. The deposition of uniform sequences of micritic limestones and marls was interrupted four times by the growth of reef complexes and the formation of expanded carbonate platforms. Coinciding with these, often abrupt, facies changes extinction events occurred which predominantly affected nektonic and planktonic organisms. Ratios of carbon- and oxygen-isotopes covary with the facies development. Periods in which the deposition of limestone-marl alternations prevailed are characterized by relatively low C- and O-isotope values. During periods of enhanced reef growth isotope values are high. For these changes, Bickert et al. (1997) assume climatic changes between humid 'H-periods', with estuarine circulation systems and eutrophic surface waters with decreased salinity in marginal seas, and arid 'A-periods', with an antiestuarine circulation and oligotrophic, stronger saline surface waters. In order to separate local and regional influences on the isotopic development from the global trend, the interactions between facies formation and isotope record have to be clarified. For this purpose, the patterns of isotope values in the upper part of the Silurian sequence on Gotland (upper Wenlock - upper Ludlow) has been determined and stratigraphically correlated along four transects through different facies areas. Facies formation during this time interval was investigated by differentiation and mapping of twelve facies complexes in the southern part of Gotland. These include shelf areas, reef complexes with patch reefs and biostromes, backreef facies, and marginal-marine deposits. The good correspondence between the carbon-isotope records of the four transects suggests that local environmental conditions in the different facies areas did not influence the δ13C values. Therefore, a supra-regional or even global mechanism for the C-isotope variations is likely. In contrast to carbon isotopes, the oxygen-isotope values of the four transects generally show parallel trends, but higher variabilities and in parts distinctly deviating developments with a trend to more negative values. These are interpreted as an effect of local warming in small shallow-water areas which developed during arid periods in reef complexes and backreef areas. The boundaries between A-periods and H-periods, as defined by δ13C values, which are interpreted as isochrones, can be mapped. From the upper Homerian to the Pridolian six parastratigraphic isotope zones are defined which only partly match the stratigraphic division of Hede (1942, 1960). The isotope stratigraphy results in an improved correlation between the shallow and marginal-marine areas in the eastern part of Gotland and the uniform shelf areas at the west coast of the island. Furthermore, a detailed relationship between the development of carbon and oxygen isotope ratios, the carbonate facies formation, and the succession of palaeontological events could be observed. At the transition from H-periods to A-periods, major extinction events occurred prior to the first increase of δ13C and δ18O values. Extinction events affected conodonts, graptolites, acritarchs, chitinozoans, and vertebrates and resulted in impoverished nektonic and planktonic communities. The reef-building benthos was less affected. Parallel to a first slight increase of isotope values, facies began to change, and reefs developed in suitable locations. The subsequent rapid increase of C- and O-isotope values occurred contemporarily with strong facies changes and a short-term drop of sea-level. Oligotrophic conditions in the later stages of A-periods led to strong reef growth and to an expansion of carbonate platforms. The transitions from A-periods to H-periods were more gradual. The δ13C values decreased slowly, but reef growth continued. Later the reefs retreated and were covered by the prograding depositional facies of shelf areas. The diversity of planktonic and nektonic communities increased again. The close relationship between facies formation, palaeontological events and isotope records in the Silurian suggests common steering mechanisms but gives no indication of the causes for the repeated extinction events related to H-period/A-period transitions. Especially the observation, that strong extinctions occurred prior to changes of isotope values and facies, points to causes that left no signals in the geological record.

The common improvements are either related to the distance measure used to assess dissimilarity, or the function used to calculate prototypes. Time-series clustering is no exception, with the Dynamic TimeWarping distance being particularly popular in that context. This distance is computationally expensive, so many related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single clustering algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested and compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this manuscript, a general overview of shape-based time-series clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time Warping and associated techniques. At the same time, a description of the dtwclust package for the R statistical software is provided, showcasing how it can be used to evaluate many different time-series clustering procedures.},

The data for the study are part of an extensive and largely unpublished 2D seismic dataset acquired between 1970 and 1990 by the Swedish Oil Prospecting Company (OPAB). The Baltic Basin is an intracratonic basin located in northern Europe. Most of the Swedish sector of the basin constitutes the NW flank of a broad synclinal depression, the Baltic Basin. In the SW of the Swedish sector lies the Hanö Bay Basin, formed by subsidence associated with inversion of the Tornquist Zone during the Late Cretaceous.The geological history presented here is broadly consistent with previously published works. We observe an area between the Hanö Bay and the Baltic Basin where the Palaeozoic strata has been affected by transpression and subsequent inversion, associated with the Tornquist Zone during the late Carboniferous-Early Permian and Late Cretaceous, respectively. We propose that the Christiansø High was a structural low during the Late Jurassic, which was later inverted in the Late Cretaceous. We suggest that a fan shaped feature in the seismic data, adjacent to the Christiansø Fault within the Hanö Bay Basin, represents rapidly deposited, coarse-grained sediments eroded from the inverted Christiansø High during the Late Cretaceous. We identify a number of faults within the deeper part of the Baltic Basin, which we also interpret to be transpressional in nature, formed during the Caledonian Orogeny in the Late Silurian-Early Devonian. East of Gotland a number of sedimentary structures consisting of Silurian carbonate reefs and Ordovician carbonate mounds, as well as a large Quaternary glacial feature are observed. Finally, we use the seismic interpretation to infer the structural and stratigraphic history of the Baltic and Hanö Bay basins within the Swedish sector.},

This event consists of a major positive carbon isotope excursion, increased biotic turnover, and other major perturbations and changes within biogeochemical cycles. This interval of time has been hypothesized to coincide with an expansion of reducing marine environments that caused increased organic carbon burial and led to the Ireviken positive carbon isotope excursion (ICIE). Previous high-resolution carbon isotope work in the Altajme core from Gotland, Sweden provides the highest resolution record of the ICIE yet documented and provides an ideal expanded stratigraphic section to study this event. Local expansion of reduced marine environments within the deeper shelf setting of the Altajme core is indicated by a positive shift in δ34Spy values and increase in pyrite sulfur concentrations at the onset of the ICIE. These data are indicative of increased microbial sulfate reduction within this portion of the Baltic Basin. Combined with new δ34SCAS data from this core, as well as additional data from distant basins, the new data presented here suggest a global expansion of reduced environments led to an increase in organic carbon burial and the ICIE.},

  abstract = {Stratigraphic correlation of geophysical well logs is one of the most important—and most time‐consuming—tasks that applied geoscientists perform on a daily basis. Using the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm, automated correlation of two wells is a fairly simple task; DTW can also be used to correlate a large number of wells along a single path. However, errors accumulate along a path and loops cannot be closed. To create a three‐dimensionally consistent correlation framework, we use a Python implementation of the Wheeler and Hale (2014) approach, which is based on the idea of stretching and squeezing all logs into a chronostratigraphic diagram that has relative geologic time (RGT) on its y ‐axis. The depth shifts needed for the RGT transformation are computed by translating the outputs of a large number of pairwise DTW correlations into a least‐squares optimization problem that is solved through the conjugate gradient method. The resulting chronostratigraphic diagram provides an overview of the overall stratigraphy and its variability; and the correlation framework is significantly different from what one could get from correlating based on lithologic similarity between two logs. To create geologically intuitive well‐log cross sections, we use a multi‐scale blocking method that relies on the continuous wavelet transform to identify stratigraphic units of a certain scale in one well and then propagate these boundaries to all the other wells. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach on a data set with close to 700 wells from the Permian Basin, West Texas. Linear channel bodies in the deepwater Spraberry Formation are easily detected and clearly highlighted in maps and cross sections. The methodology is robust enough for mapping subtle stratigraphic details, previously considered feasible only through manual interpretation. More importantly, it can be used to quickly build three‐dimensional stratigraphic models for large segments of sedimentary basins where enough log data are available.},

  abstract = {The Llandovery-lowermost Wenlock sequence in the Baltic Sea between Saaremaa and Gotland has been studied by means of high resolution seismic reflection profiling. The number and the positions of the seismic reflectors within this sequence change considerably even within short distances, thus showing a high lateral inconsistency both in lithology and thickness. Stratigraphically two unambiguous (S1 and S2) and two roughly fixed trans-Baltic seismic reflectors (S5 and S7) enabled us to distinguish the pre-Adavere, the Adavere (S1-S2 and S2-S5) and the Mustjala seismic units (S5-S7) and to follow their east-westerly changes across the Baltic. The seismic signatures and thicknesses of these units undergo a sharp transformation midway Baltic, dividing between the Saaremaa type and the Gotland type of Llandovery-lowermost Wenlock sections. This is due to a short and steep northeast-southwest facies transect that was induced by a well differentiated bathymetry in the intracratonic Palaeobaltic basin, thus clearly distinguishing the shallow-shelf (basinal), the slope (transitional) and the deep-shelf (basinal) areas. The slope is furthermore accentuated by the intensive submarine erosion and channelling during the Late Ordovician and Early Silurian times. Thus, the Saaremaa type of section includes the inner to outer shallow-shelf transect, where the pre-Adavere and Adavere units are decreasing in thickness, and the Mustjala unit is increasing in thickness towards Gotland. In the slope area offshore Gotland, all the Llandovery-lowermost Wenlock units thin out rapidly towards the deep-shelf area in south to southeast and the thickness of the pre-Adavere and Adavere units approach zero. Similar features of submarine erosion on Gotland and around the Estonian Latvian border reveal that an unstable basinal slope, from the point of sediment accumulation, extended over large areas along the shallow-shelf edge of the Palaeobaltic basin during the latest Ordovician and earliest Silurian times. Seismic data suggest that the uppermost unidentified subsurface of the Silurian succession in northern Gotland includes a considerable amount of marlstone layers that are coeval with the Mustjala Member in Estonia. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The Silurian reefs off Saaremaa in the Baltic Sea were studied by means of high-resolution seismic reflection profiling. The abundance and diversity of the reefs increases off Saaremaa concomitantly with the deepening of the Baltic Silurian Basin towards Gotland. The peak of the reefs around Saaremaa occurred during the Middle Wenlock. The reef facies retreated further off Saaremaa during the Late Wenlock, became episodically restored around the island during the early Ludlow and finally ceased during the late Ludlow. A similar SW-NE-SW migration of reefs reflects an alternating transgressive-regressive pattern in the nearshore shallow shelf environment, where already minor sea-level fluctuations strongly influenced the conditions for reef growth. During the early Wenlock, a bathymetric break with a large barrier-reef-like structure divided the shallow shelf offshore Saaremaa facially into back-reef and southerly sloping fore-reef areas. The width of this SW-migrating barrier (c. 8 km) and the extent of reef bodies within it (c. 4 km) are the largest known in the Baltic region. During the Silurian, the reefs between Saaremaa and Gotland were flourishing to a much larger extent than is visible today. The primary Silurian reef pattern was increasingly destroyed towards Gotland by later erosion. This has resulted in a large area void of Wenlock reefs off northern Gotland. Off southern Gotland, the narrow conical low-energy deeper-water reefs prevail, as the wave-agitated shallow-water facies with larger and lenticular Wenlock and Ludlow reefs are largely eroded around the Gotland Deep.

The δ\textsuperscript{13}C values of the palynomorphs are mostly lower than the δ\textsuperscript{13}C values of the bulk organic matter, and the δ\textsuperscript{13}C values of the benthic scolecodonts are lower than those of the planktonic chitinozoans. While the difference between bulk and palynomorph δ\textsuperscript{13}C may be in part a function of trophic state, the lower values of the scolecodonts relative to those of chitinozoans, which are assumed to live in the well-mixed water column, might imply an infaunal mode of life for the polychaetes that carried the scolecodonts. Lower δ\textsuperscript{13}C for the scolecodonts in the middle of the section may represent variations in primary marine productivity (supported by acritarch abundance data), oxidation of organic matter in the bottom waters, or genera effects. In general, however, trends between the three data sets are parallel, indicating similarities in the low frequency, environmentally forced controls. The δ\textsuperscript{13}C data show a decreasing trend from the base of the section, up to a horizon well below the base of the Upper Visby Formation. At this level, and therefore probably several 10 kyr before the δ\textsuperscript{13}C increase in the carbonates, the δ\textsuperscript{13}C organic values increase by ∼1‰.

We propose a new method for automatic and simultaneous well log correlation that provides a globally optimal alignment of all logs, and in addition, is relatively insensitive to large measurement errors common in well logs. First, for any number of well logs, we use a new variant of the dynamic warping method, requiring no prior geologic information, to find for each pair of logs a set of corresponding depths. Depths in one log may have one or more corresponding depths in another log, and many such pairs of corresponding depths can be found for any pair of well logs. Requiring consistency among all such pair-wise correlations gives rise to an overdetermined system of linear equations, with unknown depth shifts to be computed for each log sample. A least-squares solution of these equations, found using the conjugate gradient method, yields for every well log a sequence of depth shifts that optimally align all well logs.},

Its facies were studied at three locations ca. 50 km apart, representing different depositional settings. Its cm-scale alternations in lithological facies and elemental content (μXRF) form an excellent target for correlations on millennial timescales. Correlation attempts failed to converge to a solution at the cm-scale of individual rhythmites. Dynamic Time Warping, however, provided convincing correlations at the dm-scale, supporting its use as a high-resolution correlation tool. The Usseln Limestone base may be diachronous, but the top is likely isochronous. This finding is in agreement with sudden basin-wide black shale deposition at the onset of the Kellwasser Crisis.},

  abstract = {Seismic flattening maps a seismic volume from the original space in depth (or two-way traveltime) to the Wheeler domain in geologic time where all of the seismic reflections are horizontally aligned. It provides an efficient way to interpret a whole volume of horizons all at once by extracting the horizontal slices in the flattened space. Conventional slope-based flattening methods that can locally flatten the seismic reflections, however, often fail to flatten the reflections in a global sense and cannot accurately align the reflections across faults. We have developed an iterative method to improve the flattening by using the slopes and correlations of seismic traces. The local slopes, estimated for each image sample, can locally follow reflections but may fail to track the reflections over a long distance or correlate the reflections across faults. The seismic correlations, computed for randomly and sparsely extracted seismic traces, help to align the corresponding reflections over a long distance and across faults. We compute flattening shifts, one for each image sample, by fitting the seismic slopes and correlating in the least-squares sense. We further apply the shifts to relatively adjust the seismic samples in the vertical direction so that all of the reflections are horizontally aligned. We iteratively flatten the seismic volume by repeating the process multiple times (often less than five times). With the flattening shifts, we can compute a relative geologic time (RGT) volume that implicitly contains all the structure information of the seismic volume. An arbitrary number of horizons then can be extracted as isosurfaces of RGT values. Multiple field examples demonstrate that our method significantly improves the flattening, especially across faults and missing data zones, compared with conventional flattening methods. Our method is especially helpful to interpret subtle stratigraphic features (e.g., vertically thin channels) by providing an accurately flattened seismic volume.}

Manually correlating multiple logs can be highly subjective and labor intensive. We have developed a weighted incremental correlation method to efficiently correlate multiple well logs following a geologically optimal path. In this method, we first automatically compute an optimal path that starts with longer logs and follows geologically continuous structures. Then, we use the dynamic warping technique to sequentially correlate the logs following the path. To avoid potential error propagation with the path, we modify the dynamic warping algorithm to use all the previously correlated logs as references to correlate the current log in the path. During the sequential correlations, we compute the geologic distances between the current log and all of the reference logs. Such distances are proportional to Euclidean distances, but they increase dramatically across discontinuous structures such as faults and unconformities that separate the current log from the reference logs. We also compute correlation confidences to provide quantitative quality control of the correlation results. We use the geologic distances and correlation confidences to weight the references in correlating the current log. By using this weighted incremental correlation method, each log is optimally correlated with all the logs that are geologically closer and are ordered with higher priorities in the path. Hundreds of well logs from the Teapot Dome survey demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the method.},

The positive δ13C anomaly reaches a peak value of 9.01‰ in an interval correlated to the Icriodontid conodont Zone in the upper Eke Formation, an interval with generally impoverished fauna and strongly dominated by one single conodont species, Panderodus equicostatus, and a mass-occurrence of oncoids. The distinct morphology of this Late Ludfordian Carbon Isotope Excursion, including a well-defined rising limb, a plateau and a falling limb can be used for intercontinental correlation of the strata.},
